# Customer Support Response Generation

This project demonstrates the use of the `transformers` library to fine-tune a pre-trained T5 model for generating customer support responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
<code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-support-chatbot.git</code><br>
<code>cd customer-support-chatbot</code>

## Project Overview

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import required libraries for data loading, tokenization, and model training.
2. **Load Dataset**: Load a dataset of customer support queries and responses from Hugging Face Datasets.
3. **Tokenization**: Tokenize the dataset using the T5 tokenizer.
4. **Model Training**: Fine-tune a pre-trained T5 model on the tokenized dataset.
5. **Model Saving**: Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use.
6. **Response Generation**: Define a function to generate responses to customer queries using the fine-tuned model.

Run the notebook and get your responses...
